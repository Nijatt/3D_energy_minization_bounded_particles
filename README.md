#Energy minimization over Potential function of two bounded particles in the 3 domain space.

Note: This is just an ionic minimization, no electronic minimzation.

Abstract: This reposity is going to be computational solution of Leonard-Jones type potential energy minization process. 
Assume that there is two charged particles in 3D space. This code is minimizing the forces between those particles and changes the position of stressed system to relaxed.

In this reposity, I have proposed two potentially bounded particles in 3D space. 
Firstly we are going to develop first order derivation function for 3d potential function.
